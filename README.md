## Math Sports (Software Engineering Project)

The reason I chose this project is because it is the closest project I’ve done to a real-world application of my
knowledge. For this project, we were given customer requests and told to build something that would satisfy 
those requests. My team built a game, called Math Sports, to teach math to first and second graders. This
project touched on all of the computer science learning goals. We had to have a system-level understanding 
of the computer, understand concepts and techniques of software design, work both individually and as a team, 
and utilize problem-solving skills. To start the project, we had to design a game and the architecture behind it. 
This required us to have an understanding of computers and software design. Then, throughout the project, we 
had to work together as a team to make this design come to life. This required individual work on certain aspects 
of the game, and then us putting our individual components together as one. We had to solve various issues 
throughout the semester to create a finished product to present at the end of class. 

This project also touched on the Westminster learning goals: critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, communication, 
and global responsibility. Through the semester, my team faced many challenges we had to solve through critical 
thinking. At the beginning of the project we were given creative freedom to design an application that taught math. How
we did it and what we made was completely up to us. This was a group project so throughout the entire project we had 
to collaborate with our group members to get it done. We also collaborated with other groups, as some people in the class 
were able to answer some of our questions about technologies we were using. The group setting also required us to have 
effective communication. This kept people from working on the same thing throughout the semester, but rather each 
individual had smaller parts to put together for the final product. The goal of global responsibility came into play because 
we were making an application for education purposes. This application’s purpose is to help educate young students, which 
could affect communities at every level throughout those students’ lifetime.

**Learning Goals Above:**

- System Level Understanding of the Computer
- Concepts and Techniques of Software Design
- Acquire Significant Project Experience
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Creativity
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Global Responsibility


## Star Craft Project (Datamining Final Project)


This project touched on multiple computer science and Westminster learning goals. I am able to write in Python and 
understand datamining because of this project, which was based off Google’s Deep Mind Star-Craft data set. The objective of 
the project was to create a model using different datamining techniques to determine which game strategy would be the best 
to use at the mid-point of a Star-Craft game. In this project, my team used the Pandas and Sklearn Python packages to analyze 
data and create models to predict the best strategy. This project also helped me a great deal in my internship, as the company I 
worked for used these packages for their own data analytics. Throughout this project my group members and I had to 
communicate effectively to complete the task at hand.  We faced many problems that we had to solve, which allowed us to 
improve our problem solving skills. We developed the skill of breaking down large problems into smaller parts with easier solutions.

**Learning Goals Above:**

- Acquire Significant Project Experience
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Collaboration
- Communication



## Pig Game Project (CMPT 201 Intro To Computer Science)


I chose this project because it was the first major project I completed at Westminster. The goal of the project was to make a
basic program capable of playing the Pig Game. This program had the ability for player vs player, play vs computer, or
computer vs computer game play. This was completed using Java, which required me to have a basic understanding of object 
oriented software design. This was the first major project I completed without significant instruction or help that used multiple 
files and classes. During this project, I developed solutions to the problems I encountered. Although I did not know it at the time, 
it was my first experience with designing algorithms. One of the classes written during this project, was my own strategy for 
playing the Pig Game. This was the first time I came across creating a basic AI for playing a game. Designing my strategy required 
me to be creative, since there were already multiple strategies given and we had to develop our own. Throughout this project I had to 
solve many problems, the majority of them related to buggy code. At the time, I found it incredibly difficult to fix the smallest bug, 
which I am now able to fix in a matter of minutes.

## Graph Algorithms (CMPT 306)


To complete this lab, I had to pair programs, apply critical thinking, utilize problem solving skills and implement
different algorithms used to move through a graph. Through the paired programming, my partner and I had to communicate
and collaborate effectively to complete this lab. This is because one person drives (types) while the other provides
input on what they believe is an effective way to solve the problem. My partner and I had to use critical thinking
and problem solving to complete this assignment. We were tasked with using Python to implement algorithms that
we had a brief introduction to. This was one of the first assignments we had used Python, so it required us
to think through the algorithms and the syntax to complete it.

**Learning Goals Above:**


- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Collaboration
- Communication


## Queens (CMPT 202)

I chose Queens because it required me to think critically and analytically. This program solves the game Queens. The object
of the game is to place eight queens on a standard chess board, so none of the queens are endangered. To solve this
problem the program used backtracking. This requires you to break down the problem and handle it one queen at a time. In
each row you need to look at the rows above and check that those queens do not endanger the new queen being placed. The
algorithm used to solve this problem can be used with an expanded board and more queens. As part of the unit tests for
this program, there were boards of all sizes used. 

**Learning Goals Above:**

- Concepts and Techniques of Software Design
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking



## Ski Clock (Capstone Project)


This is by far the biggest project I have undertaken while at Westminster. Throughout this project I had to come up with an idea,
effectively communicate what that idea was, why it was a good one, and execute it. My idea was to create an
iPad application for ski shops to handle their rentals. Coming up with the idea and executing it required creativity, critical thinking,
and problem solving skills. I found a problem, the way ski shops handle rentals, came up with a creative solution, Ski Clock, and 
thought through what it would look like and how it would work. I then had to put this idea in writing and convince faculty that is was a
good idea and significant enough to warrant it being the accumulation of all my knowledge gained at Westminster. This required
effective communication. I then had to design and build the application. This required me to apply my system level understanding
of the computer, and concepts and techniques of software design I have learned through my classes at Westminster.
I then had to execute on the design. Throughout that process I had to solve multiple issues that came up during
the semester, such as bugs and design flaws. This helped develop my problem solving skills further.
