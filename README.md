## Math Sports (Software Engineering Project)

The reason I chose this project is because it is the closest project I’ve done, to a real-world application of my
knowledge. For this project, we were given customer requests and told to build something that would satisfy those 
requests. My team built a game to teach math to first and second grades called Math Sports. This project touched on all
 of the computer science learning goals. We had to have a system-level understanding of the computer, understand 
concepts and techniques of software design, work with a team and individually, and use and learn more problem-solving 
skills. To start the project, we had to design a game and the architecture behind it. This required us to have an 
understanding of computers and software design. Then, throughout the project, we had to work together as a team to make 
this design come to life. This required individual work on certain aspects of the game, and then us putting our 
individual components together as one. We had to solve various issues throughout the semester to create a finished 
product to present at the end of class. 

This project also touched on the Westminster learning goals. Critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, communication, and 
global responsibility. Through the semester my team faced many challanges that we had to solve through critical thinking. 
At the begging of the project we were given creative freedom to design an application that taught math. How we did it 
and what we made was completely up to us. This was a group project so throughout the entire project we had to collaborate
with our group members to get it done. We also collaborated with other groups, as some people in the class were able to answer
some of our questions about technologies we were using. The group setting also required us to have effective communication.
This kept people from working on the same thing throughout the semester, but rather smaller parts to put together for the final
product. We were making an application for education purposes. That is where the global responsibility comes in. This applications
purpose is to help educate young students, which could effect communities at every level throughout those students lifetime.

**Learning Goals Above:**

- System Level Understanding of the Computer

- Acquire Significant Project Experience
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Creativity
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Global Responsibilty

## Star Craft Project (Datamining Final Project)

The reason I chose this project is because it demonstrates an ability to write in python and understand 
datamining. This project was based off Google’s Deep Mind star-craft data set. The objective of the project was to 
create a model using different datamining techniques to determine which game strategy would be the best to take at the 
mid-point of a Star-Craft game. In this project, my team used the pandas and sklearn python packages to analyze data and 
create models to predict the best strategy. This project also helped me a great deal in my internship, as the company I 
worked for used these packages for their own data analytics. Throughout this project my groupmembers and I had to 
communicated effectively to complete the project. This project touched on multiple computer science learning goals and
Westminster learning goals. In this project we faced many problems that we had to solve. This required us to develop
out problem solving skills. We had to break down these problems into smaller parts that were more easily solved. 
We also had to collaborate and communicate effectivly within our group to complete the project.

**Learning Goals Above:**

- Acquire Significant Project Experience
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Collaboration
- Communication


## Pig Game Project (CMPT 201 Intro To Computer Science)

I chose this project because it was the first major project I completed at Westminster. this project was to make
a basic program capable of playing the Pig Game. This program had the ability for player vs player, play vs computer, 
or computer vs computer game play. For this project I used java. This forced me to have a basic understanding of object 
oriented software design. This was the first major project that used multiple files and classes, that I completed without 
significant instruction or help. For this project I had to identify problems, and come up with solutions to solve those 
problems. Although it did not know it at the time it was my first experience with designing algorithms. One of the 
classes written during this project, was my own strategy for playing the Pig Game. It was my first experience with a very 
basic AI for playing a simple game. Creating this strategy required me to be creative. There were already multiple
stragies given, and I had to create a new one. Throughout this project I had to solve many problems, the majority of them
were buggy code. At the time I found it incredible difficult to fix the smallest bug, that I would now fix in a matter of
minutes.

## Graph Algorithms (CMPT 306)

I chose this lab because to complete it I used paired programming, critical thinking, problem solving and had to 
implement different algorithms used to move through a graph. Through the paired programming my partner and I had to 
communicate and collaborate effectively to complete this lab. This is because one person drive (types) while the other
provides input on what they believe is an effective way to solve the problem at hand. My partner and I had to use critical
thinking and problem to complete this assignment. We were tasked with implementing algorithms that we had a brief introduction
to, and had to use Python, which at the time was a new language to us. This was on of the first assignments we had used python,
so it required us to think through the algorithms and the syntax in order to complete the assignment.

**Learning Goals Above:**

- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Collaboration
- Communication


## Queens (CMPT 202)

I chose Queens because it required me to think critically and analytically. This program solves the game Queens. The
object of the game is to place eight queens on a standard chess board, so none of the queens are endanger. To solve this 
problem the program uses backtracking. This requires you to break down the problem and handle it one queen at a time. In 
each row you need to look at the rows above and check that those queens do not endanger the new queen being placed. The 
algorithm used to solve this problem can be used with an expanded board and more queens. As part of the unit tests for 
this program, there are boards of all sizes used. 


**Learning Goals Above:**

- Concepts and Techniques of Software Design
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking


## Ski Clock (Capstone Project)

This is by far the biggest project I have undertaken while at Wesminster. Throughout this project we had to come up with an 
idea, effectivily communicate what that idea was and why it was a good one, and execute that idea. My idea was to create
an iPad app for ski shops to handel thier rentals. Coming up with the idea required creativity, critical thinking, and problem 
solving skills. I found a problem, the way ski shops handel rentals, came up with a creative solution, Ski Clock, and thought
through what it would look like and how it would work. I then had to put this idea in writing and convince faculty that is was
a good idea and siginficant enough to warrent it being the accumulation of all my knowledge gained at Westminster. This
required effective communication. I then had to design and build the application. This required me to apply my system level
understanding of the commputer,and concepts and techniques of software design I have learned through my classes at
Westminster. I then had to execute on the design. Throughout that process I had to solve multiple issues that came up
during the semester. Things like bugs and design flaws. This helped develop my problem solving skills further.
