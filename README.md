## Math Sports (Software Engineering Project)

The reason I chose this project is because it is the closest project I’ve done, to a real-world application of my
knowledge. For this project, we were given customer requests and told to build something that would satisfy those 
requests. My team built a game to teach math to first and second grades called Math Sports. This project touched on all
 of the computer science learning goals. We had to have a system-level understanding of the computer, understand 
concepts and techniques of software design, work with a team and individually, and utilize problem-solving 
skills. To start the project, we had to design a game and the architecture behind it. This required us to have an 
understanding of computers and software design. Then, throughout the project, we had to work together as a team to make 
this design come to life. This required individual work on certain aspects of the game, and then us putting our 
individual components together as one. We had to solve various issues throughout the semester to create a finished 
product to present at the end of class. 

This project also touched on the Westminster learning goals. Critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, communication, and 
global responsibility. Through the semester my team faced many challanges that we had to solve through critical thinking. 
At the begging of the project we were given creative freedom to design an application that taught math. How we did it 
and what we made was completely up to us. This was a group project so throughout the entire project we had to collaborate
with our group members to get it done. We also collaborated with other groups, as some people in the class were able to answer
some of our questions about technologies we were using. The group setting also required us to have effective communication.
This kept people from working on the same thing throughout the semester, but rather smaller parts to put together for the final
product. We were making an application for education purposes. That is where the global responsibility comes in. This applications
purpose is to help educate young students, which could effect communities at every level throughout those students lifetime.

**Learning Goals Above:**

- System Level Understanding of the Computer
- Concepts and Techniques of Software Design
- Acquire Significant Project Experience
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Creativity
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Global Responsibilty

## Star Craft Project (Datamining Final Project)

This project touched on multiple computer science and Westminster learning goals. This project demonstrates my 
ability to write in python and understand datamining. The project was based off Google’s Deep Mind Star-Craft 
data set. The objective of the project was to create a model using different datamining techniques to determine 
which game strategy would be the best to use at the mid-point of a Star-Craft game. In this project, my team used 
the pandas and sklearn python packages to analyze data and create models to predict the best strategy. This 
project also helped me a great deal in my internship, as the company I worked for used these packages for their 
own data analytics. Throughout this project my group members and I had to communicate effectively to complete 
the task at hand.  In this project we faced many problems that we had to solve. This required us to develop
our problem solving skills. We had to break down these problems into smaller parts that were more easily solved. 

**Learning Goals Above:**

- Acquire Significant Project Experience
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Collaboration
- Communication


## Pig Game Project (CMPT 201 Intro To Computer Science)

I chose this project because it was the first major project I completed at Westminster. The goal of the project was to make
a basic program capable of playing the Pig Game. This program had the ability for player vs player, play vs computer, 
or computer vs computer game play. This was completed using Java, which required me to have a basic understanding 
of object oriented software design. This was the first major project that used multiple files and classes, that I completed  
without significant instruction or help. During this project I came up with solutions to solve the problems I encountered.
Although I did not know it at the time, it was my first experience with designing algorithms. One of the classes written 
during this project, was my own strategy for playing the Pig Game. This was the first time I came across creating a 
basic AI for playing a game. Desigining my strategy required me to be creative, since there already multiple strategies 
given and had to develop our own. Throughout this project I had to solve many problems, the majority of them related
to buggy code. At the time, I found it incredible difficult to fix the smallest bug, that I would now fix in a matter of minutes.

## Graph Algorithms (CMPT 306)

To complete this lab, I had to pair program, apply critical thinking, utilize problem solving skills and  
implement different algorithms used to move through a graph. Through the paired programming, my partner and I had to 
communicate and collaborate effectively to complete this lab. This is because one person drives (types) while the other
provides input on what they believe is an effective way to solve the problem. My partner and I had to use critical
thinking and problem solving to complete this assignment. We were tasked with using Python to implement algorithms 
that we had a brief introduction to. This was one of the first assignments we had used python, so it required 
us to think through the algorithms and the syntax to complete it.

**Learning Goals Above:**

- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking
- Collaboration
- Communication


## Queens (CMPT 202)

I chose Queens because it required me to think critically and analytically. This program solves the game Queens. The
object of the game is to place eight queens on a standard chess board, so none of the queens are endanger. To solve this 
problem the program used backtracking. This requires you to break down the problem and handle it one queen at a time. In 
each row you need to look at the rows above and check that those queens do not endanger the new queen being placed. The 
algorithm used to solve this problem can be used with an expanded board and more queens. As part of the unit tests for 
this program, there are boards of all sizes used. 

**Learning Goals Above:**

- Concepts and Techniques of Software Design
- Develop Effective Problem Solving Skills
- Critical Thinking


## Ski Clock (Capstone Project)

This is by far the biggest project I have undertaken while at Wesminster. Throughout this project I had to come up with an 
idea, effectivily communicate what that idea was, why it was a good one, and execute that idea. My idea was to create
an iPad app for ski shops to handel thier rentals. Coming up with the idea required creativity, critical thinking, and problem 
solving skills. I found a problem, the way ski shops handel rentals, came up with a creative solution, Ski Clock, and thought
through what it would look like and how it would work. I then had to put this idea in writing and convince faculty that is was
a good idea and siginficant enough to warrent it being the accumulation of all my knowledge gained at Westminster. This
required effective communication. I then had to design and build the application. This required me to apply my system level
understanding of the commputer,and concepts and techniques of software design I have learned through my classes at
Westminster. I then had to execute on the design. Throughout that process I had to solve multiple issues that came up
during the semester, such as bugs and design flaws. This helped develop my problem solving skills further.
